# Practical Mathematics for Machine Learning
 This repository takes a up the approach to explain Practical Mathematical Concepts required while implementing Machine Learning Algorithms such as GMM, PCA, KMeans

### Need to understand Practical Mathematics:
Mathematics is the key to understand Machine Learning. Solid knowledge about Fundamental Mathematics on it's own does not provide meaning. Implementation of these concepts while trying to bring up algorithms such as PCA, GMM, KMeans are key here. By doing to abstarct concepts such as basis, weights start making sense and help out in bulding effieceint models.
