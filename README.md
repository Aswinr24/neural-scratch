# Neural Network Implementation Repository

Welcome to the Neural Network Implementation Repository! üöÄ

This repository adopts an upward approach to implement neural network functions, optimization techniques, as well as machine learning models from scratch.

## Features:

- **Neural Network Functions:** Explore a collection of neural network functions developed from the ground up.

- **Optimization Techniques:** Implement and experiment with various optimization techniques for enhancing model performance.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Build machine learning models from scratch, gaining a deeper understanding of their inner workings.

## Getting Started:

To get started, clone the repository and explore the well-documented codebase. Feel free to contribute and enhance the functionalities.  
Please read the CONTRIBUTING.md to know more.

## Goals:

Our goal is to foster a deep understanding of neural networks, optimization, and machine learning by providing hands-on implementation experience.

Happy coding! üñ•Ô∏èüß†
